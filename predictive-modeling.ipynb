    "The above code uses the Random Forest Classifier to predict employee turnover, which is a binary classification problem. You can also try different classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc. The code uses the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data, and then its predictions are compared to the actual values in the test data to calculate the accuracy. You can also use other evaluation metric like f1_score, precision, recall, AUC_ROC, etc. It also prints the confusion matrix which is a good evaluation metric for binary classification problem."
